The main task of this project is to demonstrate the visualization power of ggplot2 package within R.

The dataset being used is NEI (National Emissions Inventory), provided by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The goal is to analyze atmosphere pollution with PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) and verify national ambient air quality standards for fine PM.
